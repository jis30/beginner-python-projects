# beginner-python-projects
These are my first projects as a beginner going into Software Engineering
I've wanted to push my career into Software Engineering because it's the easiest thing I can do as of now
And in the past I was decently good at coding overal and wanting to create what I want
creating my own games, programs, websites, something like that
I've wanted to learn more about Java, Javascript, C++, and HTML
But the only way I could learn how to code is online classes because of the current school i'm in
I'm using a Laptop as my current computer and I'm also hoping to upgrade to something better very soon!
I will always do my best when creating programs and learning various coding languages and possibly collab with other developers when time comes
